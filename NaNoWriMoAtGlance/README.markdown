# NaNoWriMoAtGlance

"NaNo-Remote-Glance" is a Windows 8.1 Live Tile proxy site for [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org).
It is built to allow interested users to choose a set of Live Tile notifications, based upon the NaNoWriMo
Word Count API, and it will build a page with the appropriate META tags and links to XML documents
to show a word count Live Tile in Windows 8.1.
